## README: LangTransGAN

LangTransGAN is a novel language translation model inspired by the "TransGAN: Two Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN" paper. It combines the generative capabilities of GANs with the contextual understanding of BERT to enhance machine translation quality. The model features a BERT-based generator for robust text generation and a fine-tuned BERT discriminator for distinguishing authentic translations. By leveraging the WMT-14 English-French dataset, LangTransGAN aims to push the boundaries of translation performance through innovative architecture and training techniques.

This project was inspired by the groundbreaking work presented in the paper "TransGAN: Two Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN." We extend our gratitude to the authors for their innovative contributions to the field of generative models, which motivated us to explore and develop the LangTransGAN model.
